# IIoTOnto
This repository contains the IIoT Ontology (IIoTOnto) Protégé files and Taxonomy.

The IIoTOnto was created to address semantic and syntactic interoperability challenges within Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. It achieves this by combining several well-established ontologies from the literature, such as IoT-Lite and QUDT, alongside IEEE-standardized ontologies, to craft a specialized one for IIoT applications. Furthermore, the proposed ontology includes crucial concepts relevant to industrial applications previously absent in the based ontologies. 

The figure above showcases a portion of the IIoTOnto, comprising more than 450 classes and 40 properties, that have been expanded with the ontologies above and newly introduced classes related to IIoT applications.
