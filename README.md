This repository contains the IIoT Ontology (IIoTOnto) Protégé files and Taxonomy.

### IIoTOnto

The IIoTOnto was created to address semantic and syntactic interoperability challenges within Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. It achieves this by combining several well-established ontologies from the literature, such as SSN (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/), IoT-Lite (https://www.w3.org/Submission/iot-lite/), QUDT (https://qudt.org/), alongside 1872-2015 - IEEE Standard Ontologies for Robotics and Automation (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7084073), to craft a specialized one for IIoT applications. Furthermore, the proposed ontology includes crucial concepts relevant to industrial applications previously absent in the based ontologies.

The figure above showcases a portion of the IIoTOnto, comprising more than 450 classes and 40 properties, that have been expanded with the ontologies above and newly introduced classes related to IIoT applications.
