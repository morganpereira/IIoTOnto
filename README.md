This repository contains the IIoT Ontology (IIoTOnto) Protégé files and Taxonomy.

### IIoTOnto

The IIoTOnto was created to address semantic and syntactic interoperability challenges within Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. It achieves this by combining several well-established ontologies from the literature, such as IoT-Lite and QUDT, alongside IEEE-standardized ontologies, to craft a specialized one for IIoT applications. Furthermore, the proposed ontology includes crucial concepts relevant to industrial applications previously absent in the based ontologies. 

The figure above showcases a portion of the IIoTOnto, comprising more than 450 classes and 40 properties, that have been expanded with the ontologies above and newly introduced classes related to IIoT applications.
